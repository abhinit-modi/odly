# Love and Connection

Love is a fundamental human emotion that manifests in various forms - romantic love, familial love, friendship, and self-love. Research in psychology suggests that strong emotional connections contribute significantly to mental and physical health.

The ancient Greeks identified at least six different types of love, including Philia (deep friendship), Eros (romantic love), Storge (family love), and Agape (unconditional love).
