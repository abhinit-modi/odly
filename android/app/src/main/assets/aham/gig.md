{Ideas}
* An agent to behave as a Manager capable of hosting and channeling interns
* A language based job search agent
* Agent to create starter projects or hiring projects
* Use apps as tools on device.
* Everyday summarizer, photo reader and moment appreciator
* Think about domain specific tasks where latency and privacy are important - seed for on device apps
* Build a search agent on printed documents using LayoutLM and Sarvam M chat
* Browsing as an experience is different for different people. A memory layer with a local browser application

{projects}
* Use liquidAI to build an agency server for mobile
* e2e tuning for a gen bio use case
* e2e use case for a small on device model
* Create a repo with orpo, dpo and Lora tuning on a use case, quantize it during training, use accelerate fsdp and deepspeed zero on sagemaker for training, and deploy it on vllm
* Repo for creating agentic apps of your own using on device models. The framework will have support for on-device storage, inference. Make it easy to create a service. Run it on iOS too
